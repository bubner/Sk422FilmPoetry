                    Observing the <button class="annotation" id="a18" onclick="hideRequiredModalText(17);">gates of chaos and the mind,</button> <br>
                    I sense the oncoming of those <button class="annotation" id="a19" onclick="hideRequiredModalText(18);">sand-blind.</button> <br>
                    The eternal <button class="annotation" id="a20" onclick="hideRequiredModalText(19);">ransom of impending doom,</button> <br>
                    will come forth and apply <button class="annotation" id="a21" onclick="hideRequiredModalText(20);">everlasting gloom.</button> <br>

                    I look at those that <button class="annotation" id="a22" onclick="hideRequiredModalText(21);">have now come to ferment;</button> <br>
                    Ah, the <button class="annotation" id="a23" onclick="hideRequiredModalText(22);">memories,</button> a war of torment. <br>
                    The mind and body may call it a <button class="annotation" id="a24" onclick="hideRequiredModalText(23);">gift at the finish,</button> <br>
                    but the race is far from over for the <button class="annotation" id="a25" onclick="hideRequiredModalText(24);">soul who had diminished.</button> <br>
                    <br> <br>
                    The soul and spirit are a construct at one, <br>
