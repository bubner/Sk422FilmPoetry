                    Unlying creation through the portal of negation, <br>
                    we find the missing and needed debation. <br>
                    Suffering in which this ridden pearl, <br>
                    a mental war in the cyberworld. <br>
                    And as I stow and leap as a freeman, <br>
                    I’m come to fear with the demon. <br>
                    <br> <br>
                    I’m lost in despair and solemn breath, <br>
                    how can one hide from death? <br>
                    Why should I rise with given sight <br>
                    if yet I’m going to suffer endless fright? <br>
                    <br> <br>
                    I’ve lost all sense and will to survive, <br>
                    numb to the stories those contrive. <br>
                    I must hold on for hope to arrive, <br>
                    at the scope of writing the deep archive.

                    Looking down, I’m lost in the net, <br>
                    of serious debate and questions as yet. <br>
                    The world looks upon me as I’ve done no harm, <br>
                    but still finds me as guilty as a firearm. <br>
                    <br> <br>
                    Day after day, I return in dismay, <br>
                    finding my child has been a puppet at play. <br>
                    It is due now and profound for that child to depart, <br>
                    but I can’t set the values that those have taken heart. <br>
                    <br> <br>
                    It is not my doing in this insufferable fate; <br>
                    it was only caused by the comrades we hate. <br>
                    But under the surface and into the lore, <br>
                    why does my child have to fall into great war? <br>
                    <br> <br>
                    The help and support of the ones at the shore, <br>
                    may continue to help stop such uproar, <br>
                    But whether they do or fail to abide, <br>
                    the scars will remain under hidden confide.

                    Observing the gates of chaos and the mind, <br>
                    I sense the oncoming of those sand-blind. <br>
                    The eternal ransom of impending doom, <br>
                    will come forth and apply everlasting gloom. <br>
                    <br> <br>
                    I look at those that have now come to ferment; <br>
                    Ah, the memories, a war of torment. <br>
                    The mind and body may call it a gift at the finish, <br>
                    but the race is far from over for the soul who had diminished. <br>
                    <br> <br>
                    The soul and spirit are a construct at one, <br>
                    simple words that cannot be outrun; <br>
                    Moving forth, my witness is in despair, <br>
                    but alas, time simply cannot repair. <br>
                    <br> <br>
                    As the tides spin, my role succeeds; <br>
                    the court of life still proceeds. <br>
                    And as one finds their humility in mind, <br>
                    they will seek their undefined.

                    The stars continue to shine, our stellar missing pledge; <br>
                    reality can’t comprehend, the knife cutting edge. <br>
                    A free reign of words, hidden in disguise, <br>
                    a true hidden meaning, a world despised. <br>
                    <br> <br>
                    The light from the stars doesn’t give a return, <br>
                    even from the worst sunburn. <br>
                    I can’t have back what I lost in the storm, <br>
                    losing myself stuck as a hopeless life form. <br>
                    <br> <br>
                    I can’t find a way out from this endless loop, <br>
                    I grieve and miss but continue to scoop. <br>
                    The damages I’ve done to the people in my oath, <br>
                    have lost their light in their mental growth. <br>
                    <br> <br>
                    My sky is darkened, and it’s impossible to guide, <br>
                    but no one’s here to stop the flood tide. <br>
                    I wish I could stop, but the voice continues to roll, <br>
                    “No one can save you from this loophole.”

                    I watch on the horizon as the ground begins to shake, <br>
                    it appears another soul is at the hostile stake. <br>
                    I cannot interfere in the rights of the wave, <br>
                    I can merely look and gaze upon the brave. <br>
                    <br> <br>
                    Forever days will pass as the plague ensues, <br>
                    one man’s actions cannot diffuse. <br>
                    The humble in this world will condemn the many, <br>
                    but are still unable to defeat the plenty. <br>
                    <br> <br>
                    One must only hope the abuse will end, <br>
                    but will never be able to curve the bend. <br>
                    Our plane of existence is coated in remorse; <br>
                    Don’t get lost, you’ve hardly finished the course.
